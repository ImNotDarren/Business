# Project Proposal - Darren Liu
## Client

**Lyft**
- to increase its market share

## Question/Need

Lyft is an app similar to Uber but it's not performing as well as Uber. According to our dataset,
54% of the customers use Uber and 46% of them use Lyft. There isn't a big difference which is good
news, but by analyzing Uber and Lyft ride dataset, we're able to provide Lyft a solution to make its
market share even bigger and gain more profit.

## Data discription

I'll use the Uber and Lyft rideshare dataset in Boston, MA. It contains 693071 rows and 57 columns.
This dataset is kind of large so I won't be using all of the rows. I'll sample around 2000 rows
and focus on 10-20 columns that provide the most important information.

## Solution path

Uber and Lyft rideshare data in Boston are accessable for analysis. This dataset shows each ride's
time, destination, price, distance, weather and so on. This can give us lots of information on
people's preference of booking taxies which can help Lyft improve their service.

## Criteria for Success

Success would be showing visualizations to address the client's problems and give practical
solutions based on the results.

## Assumptions and Risks

**Assumptions:**
- Uber customers will immediately move to Lyft once Uber solves it's problem.
- Uber is not making any improvement in the meantime.

**Risks:**
- Data in Boston may not reflect all situations in the US. Applying the solution generated from
this dataset may not suit well in other states.

## Tools
* **Google Sheets**, **Microsoft Excel** and **SQLite** for exploratory data analysis
* **Tableau** for visualization.

## MVP goal
My MVP goal would be to use data to address the cause to the problem and give a rough
solution to the problem.
