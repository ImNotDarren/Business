# Project Proposal - Darren Liu
## Background Story

Teamfight Tactics is a Riot game in League of Legends. It used to be very popular in
Set 6, but after the update of Set 7, it's losing a lot of players. I'm trying to use
exploratory data analysis to address the cause of the problem and give a solution to it.

## Data discription

I'll use the player data of riot. Each row will represent each game, containing each
player's combo, traits, game time, etc. I haven't find a usable dataset yet but the dataset
will include as many entries as possible. I'll update the dataset information as soon as
I find it.

## Tools
* **Google Sheets** and **SQLite** for exploratory data analysis
* **Tableau** for visualization.

## MVP goal
My MVP goal would be to use data to address the cause to the problem and give a rough
solution to the problem.
