# Project Proposal - Darren Liu
## Background Story

Uber used to be the No.1 transportation app in the world, but it's market is gradually taken
by Lyft and some other transportation apps. By analyzing Uber and Lyft ride dataset, we're
able to provide Uber a solution to increase its market and gain more profit.

## Data discription

I'll use the Uber and Lyft ride dataset in Boston, MA. It contains 693071 rows and 57 columns.
This dataset is kind of large so I won't be using all of the rows. I'll sample around 2000 rows
and focus on 10-20 columns that provide the most important information.

## Tools
* **Google Sheets** and **SQLite** for exploratory data analysis
* **Tableau** for visualization.

## MVP goal
My MVP goal would be to use data to address the cause to the problem and give a rough
solution to the problem.
