# Project Proposal - Darren Liu
## Background Story

Uber used to be the No.1 transportation app in the world, but it's market is gradually taken
by Lyft and some other transportation apps. By analyzing Uber and Lyft ride dataset, we're
able to provide Uber a solution to increase its market and gain more profit.

## Solution path

Uber and Lyft ride data in Boston are accessable for analysis. This dataset shows each ride's
time, destination, price, distance, weather and so on. This can give us lots of information on
people's preference of booking taxies which can help Uber improve their service.

## Data discription

I'll use the Uber and Lyft ride dataset in Boston, MA. It contains 693071 rows and 57 columns.
This dataset is kind of large so I won't be using all of the rows. I'll sample around 2000 rows
and focus on 10-20 columns that provide the most important information.

## Tools
* **Google Sheets**, **Microsoft Excel** and **SQLite** for exploratory data analysis
* **Tableau** for visualization.

## MVP goal
My MVP goal would be to use data to address the cause to the problem and give a rough
solution to the problem.
