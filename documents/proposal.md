# Project Proposal - Darren Liu
## Background Story

Nowadays, because of the COVID situation, used cars are getting more and more expensive.
People are usually confused if they should get a car now or if they should wait. Hence,
more and more people need a car price predicting tool to predict the price of used cars
to avoid spending too much money.

## Data discription

The data I need for the model will be collected by scraping cars.com, where I can get
the car's price, year, model, milage, engine and so on. Each row will represent a car's
information. The data will be divide into two parts: training data and testing data. The
training data will be used to train the model and the testing data will be used to test
the accuracy.

## Tools
I'll be using Google Sheets for exploratory data analysis, Tableau for visualization.

## MVP goal
My MVP goal would be to use data to address the client's problem and give a rough solution
to the problem.
